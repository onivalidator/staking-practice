This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Let's add a TODO list to this README.

Under it let's add

- Incorporate a .json to keep and store state of certain variables which are called, so that we can call APIs less often. Include something which records time in UTC.

We should have the staking-dashboard store this state with the time last checked, and if greater than 30 minutes it should query APIs and try to update. It should never write a null value or error to the state json and only update json's last time with a valid query (for each API variable that is called).

Each variable should have it's own state and time state was last changed correctly.

We want to store (token_price), (delegated_token_amount and block_height) and time of last successful update for each variable.
